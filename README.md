# Oliver Baptiste's dotfiles

This is my first attempt at a dotfile repository.

I am using the technique described by Drew DeVault's blog post
[Managing my dotfiles as a git repository](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html), which I discovered on [dotfiles.github.io/tutorials](http://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/).
