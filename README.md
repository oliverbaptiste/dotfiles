# Oliver Baptiste's dotfiles

This is my first attempt at a dotfile repository.

I used to use the technique described in Drew DeVault’s blog post
“[Managing my dotfiles as a git repository](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html),”
which I discovered on [dotfiles.github.io/tutorials](http://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/).

Nowadays, I'm just uploading these files using the Github website interface.
